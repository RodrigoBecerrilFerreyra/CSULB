This is a collection of almost all my work while I studied Computer Engineering
at California State University, Long Beach. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree
in May 2022. Some of the work here is also available in other repositories on
my GitHub account [https://github.com/RodrigoBecerrilFerreyra](RodrigoBecerrilFerreyra).
