\section{Test Program}
Figure \ref{screenshot:test-program} shows the screenshot of
\c{test-program.asm} running on QtSPIM.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/QtSPIMtestprogram}
    \caption{\c{test-program.asm} (feel free to zoom in).}
    \label{screenshot:test-program}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Nine total instructions are executed.
    \item The registers \c{\$t2}, \c{\$t3}, \c{\$t4}, and
    \c{\$t5} are all directly used in calculations, along with
    \c{\$v0}, which is used for the \c{syscall}.
    Registers \c{\$at},
    \c{\$a0}, \c{\$a1}, and \c{\$a2} as well as \c{\$sp} are
    all used by the simulated computer automatically, without
    an explicit command.
    \item The address \c{0x10010004} is changed when the command
    \c{sw} is used. This is the address of \c{Z}. (Address
    \c{0x10010000} is also used, but is not changed.)
    It is interesting to note that loading in the address of
    a bit in memory is done in two instructions rather than one,
    because load commands have a limitation of only being able
    to store 16 bits in its last field.
    \item The only \c{syscall} that is used is 10, which
    simply ends the program. If it were not there, QtSPIM
    would give an error when the program tries to go past
    the last instruction.
