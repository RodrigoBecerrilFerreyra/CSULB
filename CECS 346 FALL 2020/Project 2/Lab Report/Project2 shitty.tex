\section{Introduction} The goal of this project is to
extend the functionality of Project 1 by adding a
stepper motor and changing some functionality, such as the
buttons. Specifically, the changes to Project 1 are listed
below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A stepper motor (28BYJ-48 driven by a ULN2003A
    Darlington transistor array) was added.
    \item \c{sw2} was removed and instead replaced with a
    toggle functionality for \c{sw1}.
    \item Timing for flashes adjusted slightly.
\end{itemize}

For more in-depth details about the rest of the functionality
of this project, please refer to the Project 1 Report.

\section{Stepper Motor} As noted previously, the stepper
motor used for this project is the
28BYJ-48\footnote{\url{http://robocraft.ru/files/datasheet/28BYJ-48.pdf}}, a unipolar
stepper motor, which is driven by the ULN2003A(N)%
\footnote{\url{https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/29528/TI/ULN2003AN.html}}
integrated circuit. The motor/driver system takes
in four signal inputs and a \SI{5}{V} power input. Its four
signal inputs are capable of driving the motor with only
\SI{8}{\milli\ampere} of current from the microcontroller's
GPIO ports.

For this project, if the state transitions from green to
blue, the motor will rotate a certain direction (say clockwise)
to symbolize a garage door opening or closing; if the state
transitions from blue to green, the motor will rotate the
opposite direction (say counterclockwise).

Making the stepper motor rotate is achieved using the
``wave-driving'' technique; this means that only one coil is
energized at a time, and the coil that is energized at any
given time is situated next to the coil that was previously
energized (coils 1 and 4 act as if they were next to each other).

\section{Miscellaneous Changes} The functionality for \c{sw2}
was removed; instead, a toggle functionality was added to \c{sw1}.
If the current state is green, pressing the button will
make the system transition to blue;
if the current state is blue, pressing the button will
make the system transition to green.
